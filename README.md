# discordGPyT: A Discord bot that implements the OpenAI API for messaging and bot commands

The bot was build to be run on Replit. The version that I run can be found here: https://replit.com/@Xing-YangYang1  

To view the development projects involved with the bot (i.e. frontend interface, the bot adding commands to itself, e.t.c) check out the development branch in this repository.

#### Notes:  
The Discord Developer API and OpenAI API keys are required to run this.  
This branch, master, used to be the completely different version in development.  
The original version had different features with it, like a Flask Server and a website.
